Muscle Segmentation in MSOT Images


This project aims at the Segmentation of Muscle Tissue in Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography Images.

For this purpose, a Deep Learning architecture will be used. Baseline is established on a classic UNET, which is then slightly altered to be used for an active deep learning framework, namely include Monte Carlo Dropout techniques for uncertainty estimation.
